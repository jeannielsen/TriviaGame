# TriviaGame

Description:
  This was an assignment to make a trivia game that has a timer and indicts if the answer is correct or incorrect.  If the answer is incorrect the correct answer should be displayed.
  
Languages Used:  
HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and jQuery

Takeaways:  
The timer function was challenging and I was not able to get the image to display when the correct, incorrect, or time out text was shown.

Feedback:  
I found this game particularly challenging and made several false starts.  Initially, I thought I would use the carousel function to display the questions and answers.  I later started on the simpler version with all questions on the same page, but soon realized that once I was able to switch out screens, the challenge problem was not much more difficult.
